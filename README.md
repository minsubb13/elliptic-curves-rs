# Elliptic curve cryptography

## Practice a implementation of elliptic-curve cryptography in Rust

### Purpose

This repository aims to implement elliptic-curve cryptography in Rust. I implemented this before using C++ in [elliptic-curve-cryptography](https://github.com/minsubb13/elliptic-curve-cryptography). So, I am going to reimplement this in Rust.
