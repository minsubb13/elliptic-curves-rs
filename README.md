# Elliptic curve cryptography

## Practice a implementation of elliptic-curve cryptography in Rust

### Purpose

This repository aims to implement elliptic-curve cryptography in Rust. I implemented this before using C++ in [elliptic-curve-cryptography](https://github.com/minsubb13/elliptic-curve-cryptography). So, I am going to reimplement this in Rust. And this code is implemented based on this posts [Elliptic Curve Cryptography: a gentle introduction
](https://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/17/elliptic-curve-cryptography-a-gentle-introduction/), too.
